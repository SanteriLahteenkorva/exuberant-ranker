# exuberant-ranker

Designed as a tool for making top lists and rankings. A learning project for getting to know Crystal. The goal is to make the ranker usable from command line first and then later on add a graphical user interface as an option.

## Usage

Usage instructions will be added here once the project reaches a state where it is usable.

## Development

Made this open source for no particular reason and don't expect this to be ever developed by anyone else.
