# exuberant-ranker

Designed as a tool for making top lists and rankings. A learning project for getting to know Crystal. The goal is to make the ranker usable from command line first and then later on add a graphical user interface as an option.

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  exuberant-ranker:
    github: [your-github-name]/exuberant-ranker
```

## Usage

```crystal
require "exuberant-ranker"
```

TODO: usage instructions will be added here once the project reaches a state where it is usable.

## Development

Made this open source for no particular reason and don't expect this to be ever developed by anyone else.
